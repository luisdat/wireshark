= Wireshark {wireshark-version} Release Notes
// Asciidoctor Syntax Quick Reference:
// https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/

This is an experimental release intended to test new features for Wireshark 4.4.

== What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer.
It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

== What’s New

// Add a summary of **major** changes here.
// Add other changes to "New and Updated Features" below.

Improved display filter support for value strings (optional string
representations for numeric fields).

Display filter functions can be implemented as runtime-loadable C plugins.

Plugin registration API was refactored. Plugin authors must update their
plugins as described below.

Custom columns can be defined using any valid field expression, such as
display filter functions, slices, arithmetic calculations, logical tests,
raw byte addressing, and the layer modifier.

Many other improvements have been made.
See the “New and Updated Features” section below for more details.

//=== Bug Fixes

//The following bugs have been fixed:
//* wsbuglink:5000[]
//* wsbuglink:6000[Wireshark bug]
//* cveidlink:2014-2486[]
//* Wireshark grabs your ID at 3 am, goes to Waffle House, and insults people.

=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated) since version 4.2.0:

//* The Windows installers now ship with Qt 6.5.2.
//  They previously shipped with Qt 6.2.3.

* Display filter syntax-related enhancements:

  ** Better handling of comparisons with value strings. Now the display filter engine can
     correctly handle cases where multiple different numeric values map to the same value
     string, including but not limited to range-type value strings.

  ** Fields with value strings now support regular expression matching.

  ** Date and time values now support arithmetic, with some restrictions:
     the multiplier/divisor must be an integer or float and appear on the right-hand
     side of the operator.

  ** The keyword "bitand" can be used as an alternative syntax for the bitwise-and operator.

  ** Functions alone can now be used as an entire logical expression.
     The result of the expression is the truthiness of the function return
     value (or of all values if more than one). This is useful for example to write
     "len(something)" instead of "len(something) != 0". Even more so if a function
     returns itself a boolean value, it is now possible to write
     "bool_test(some.field)" instead of having to write "bool_test(some.field) == True"
     (both forms are now valid).

  ** Display filter references can be written without curly braces. It
     is now possible to write `$frame.number` instead of `${frame.number}` for example.

  ** Added new display filter functions to test various IP address properties.
     Check the wireshark-filter(5) manpage for more information.

  ** Display filter macros can be written with a semicolon after the macro
     name before the argument list, e.g. `${mymacro;arg1;...;argN}`, instead
     of `${mymacro:arg1;...;argN}`. The version with semicolons works better
     with pop-up suggestions when editing the display filter, so the version
     with the colon might be removed in the future.

  ** Display filter macros can be written using a function-like notation.
     The macro `${mymacro:arg1;...;argN}` can be written
     `$mymacro(arg1,...,argN)`.

* Display filter functions can be implemented as libwireshark plugins. Plugins are loaded
  during startup from the usual binary plugin configuration directories. See the
  `ipaddr.c` source file in the distribution for an example of a display filter C plugin
  and the doc/plugins.example folder for generic instructions how to build a plugin.

* Display filter autocompletions now also include display filter functions.

* The display filter macro configuration file has changed format. It now uses
  the same format as the "dfilters" file and has been renamed accordingly to
  "dmacros". Internally it no longer uses the UAT API and the display filter macro
  GUI dialog has been updated. There is some basic migration logic implemented
  but it is advisable to check that the "dfilter_macros" (old) and
  "dmacros" (new) files in the profile directory are consistent.

* Custom columns can be defined using any valid field expression:

  ** Display filter functions, like `len(tcp.payload)`, including nested functions
     like `min(len(tcp.payload), len(udp.payload)` and newly defined functions
     using the plugin system mentioned above. wsbuglink:15990[] wsbuglink:16181[]

  ** Arithmetic calculations, like `ip.len * 8` or `tcp.srcport + tcp.dstport`.
     wsbuglink:7752[]

  ** Slices, like `tcp.payload[4:4]`. wsbuglink:10154[]

  ** The layer operator, like `ip.proto#1` to return the proto field in the
     first IPv4 layer if there is tunneling. wsbuglink:18588[]

  ** Raw byte addressing, like `@ip`, useful to return the bytes of a protocol
     or FT_NONE field, among others. wsbuglink:19076[]

  ** Logical tests, like `tcp.port == 443`, which produce a check mark if
     the test matches (similar to protocol and none fields without `@`.)
     This works with all logical operators, including e.g. regular expression
     matching (`matches` or `~`.)

  ** Defined display filter macros.

  ** Any combination of the above also works.

  ** Multifield columns are still available. For backwards compatibility,
     `X or Y` is interpreted as a multifield column as before. To represent a
     logical test for the presence of multiple fields instead of concatenating
     values, use parenthesis, like `(tcp.options.timestamp or tcp.options.nop`.

  ** Field references are not implemented, because there's no sense of a
     currently selected frame. "Resolved" column values (such as host name
     resolution or value string lookup) are not supported for any of the new
     expressions yet.

* When selecting "Manage Interfaces" from "Capture Options", Wireshark only
  attempts to reconnect to rpcap (remote) hosts that were connected to in the
  last session, instead of every remote host that the current profile has ever
  connected to. wsbuglink:17484[]

* Adding interfaces at startup is about twice as fast, and has many fewer
  UAC pop-ups when npcap is installed with access restricted to Administrators
  on Windows

* The Resolved Addresses dialog only shows what addresses and ports are
  present in the file (not including information from static files), and
  selected rows or the entire table can be saved or copied to the clipboard
  in several formats.

* New menu:Tools[Install Plugin] option provides a convenient method to install
  a binary plugin to the personal folder.

* The personal binary plugins folder now has higher priority than the global
  folder.

* The binary plugins folder path no longer uses an X.Y version component. Plugins
  are required to add the ABI version to the file name.

* Truncated fields in the detail view are now displayed as "Field name […]: data" instead of "Field name [truncated]: data"

* When capturing files in multiple file mode, a pattern that places the date and time
  before the index number can be used (e.g., foo_20240714110102_00001.pcap instead of
  foo_00001_20240714110102.pcap). This causes filenames to sort in chronological order
  across file sets from different captures. The File Set dialog has been updated to
  handle the new pattern, which has been capable of being produced by tshark since
  version 3.6.0

* The "Follow Stream" dialog can now show delta times between turns and all packets and events.

=== Removed Features and Support

* The tshark `-G` option with no argument is deprecated and will be removed in
  a future version. Use `tshark -G fields` to produce the same report.

=== Removed Dissectors

The Parlay dissector has been removed.

=== Major API Changes

* Plugin registration API was refactored. Plugin authors must do the following:
  1 - Remove the existing boilerplate (version, want_major` and `want_minor` and
  plugin API declarations. 2 - Add a struct ws_module to the plugin.
  3 - Call one of the WIRESHARK_PLUGIN_REGISTER_* macros. See README.plugins
  sections 5 and doc/plugins.example/hello.c for details and examples.

== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system specific to that platform.
A list of third-party packages can be found on the
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
These locations vary from platform to platform.
You can use menu:Help[About Wireshark,Folders] or `tshark -G folders` to find the default locations on your system.
