0. Plugins

There are a multitude of plugin options available in Wireshark that allow to
extend its functionality without changing the source code itself.  Using the
available APIs gives you the means to do this.

Plugins have three distinct binary types:
  * codec: These plugins are loaded by Wireshark to implement audio codecs
  * wiretap: These plugins can implement various extensions to libwiretap
  * epan: These plugins implement extensions to libwireshark

Within each type we can differentiate by the features and APIs used. There
are the following functional types:

  * codec: is its own class of functionality, described above
  * dissector (epan): implements new protocol dissectors
  * tap listener (epan): implements statistics and other extensions using taps
  * dfunction (epan): implements new display filter functions
  * epan (epan): used to implement language bindings such as Lua
  * file type (wiretap): implements support for reading new capture file types

1. Dissector plugins

Writing a "plugin" dissector is not very different from writing a standard
one.  In fact all of the functions described in README.dissector can be
used in the plugins exactly as they are used in standard dissectors.

(Note, however, that not all OSes on which Wireshark runs can support
plugins.)

If you've chosen "foo" as the name of your plugin (typically, that would
be a short name for your protocol, in all lower case), the following
instructions tell you how to implement it as a plugin.  All occurrences
of "foo" below should be replaced by the name of your plugin.

2. The directory for the plugin, and its files

The plugin should be placed in a new plugins/epan/foo directory which should
contain at least the following files:

CMakeLists.txt
README

The README can be brief but it should provide essential information relevant
to developers and users. Optionally AUTHORS and ChangeLog files can be added.
Optionally you can add your own plugin.rc.in.

And of course the source and header files for your dissector.

Examples of these files can be found in plugins/epan/gryphon.

2.1 CMakeLists.txt

For your plugins/epan/foo/CMakeLists.txt file, see the corresponding file in
plugins/epan/gryphon.  Replace all occurrences of "gryphon" in those files
with "foo" and add your source files to the DISSECTOR_SRC variable.

2.2 plugin.rc.in

Your plugins/epan/foo/plugin.rc.in is the Windows resource template file used
to add the plugin specific information as resources to the DLL.
If not provided the plugins/plugin.rc.in file will be used.

3. Changes to existing Wireshark files

There are two ways to add your plugin dissector to the build, as a custom
extension or as a permanent addition.  The custom extension is easy to
configure, but won't be used for inclusion in the distribution if that's
your goal.  Setting up the permanent addition is somewhat more involved.

3.1 Custom extension

For CMake builds, either pass the custom plugin dir on the CMake generation
step command line:

CMake ... -DCUSTOM_PLUGIN_SRC_DIR="plugins/epan/foo"

or copy the top-level file CMakeListsCustom.txt.example to CMakeListsCustom.txt
(also in the top-level source dir) and edit so that CUSTOM_PLUGIN_SRC_DIR is
set() to the relative path of your plugin, e.g.

set(CUSTOM_PLUGIN_SRC_DIR plugins/epan/foo)

and re-run the CMake generation step.

To build the plugin, run your normal Wireshark build step.

If you want to add the plugin to your own Windows installer add a text
file named custom_plugins.txt to the packaging/nsis directory, with a
"File" statement for NSIS:

File "${STAGING_DIR}\plugins\${MAJOR_VERSION}.${MINOR_VERSION}\epan\foo.dll"

3.2 Permanent addition

In order to be able to permanently add a plugin take the following steps.
You will need to change the following files:
	CMakeLists.txt
	packaging/nsis/wireshark.nsi

You might also want to search your Wireshark development directory for
occurrences of an existing plugin name, in case this document is out of
date with the current directory structure.  For example,

	grep -rl gryphon .

could be used from a shell prompt.

3.2.1  Changes to CMakeLists.txt

Add your plugin (in alphabetical order) to the PLUGIN_SRC_DIRS:

if(ENABLE_PLUGINS)
        ...
        set(PLUGIN_SRC_DIRS
                ...
                plugins/epan/ethercat
                plugins/epan/foo
                plugins/epan/gryphon
                plugins/epan/irda
                ...

3.2.2  Changes to the installers

If you want to include your plugin in an installer you have to add lines
in the NSIS installer wireshark.nsi file.

3.2.2.1  Changes to packaging/nsis/wireshark.nsi

Add the relative path of your plugin DLL (in alphabetical order) to the
list of "File" statements in the "Dissector Plugins" section:

File "${STAGING_DIR}\plugins\${MAJOR_VERSION}.${MINOR_VERSION}\epan\ethercat.dll"
File "${STAGING_DIR}\plugins\${MAJOR_VERSION}.${MINOR_VERSION}\epan\foo.dll"
File "${STAGING_DIR}\plugins\${MAJOR_VERSION}.${MINOR_VERSION}\epan\gryphon.dll"
File "${STAGING_DIR}\plugins\${MAJOR_VERSION}.${MINOR_VERSION}\epan\irda.dll"

3.2.2.2  Other installers

The PortableApps installer copies plugins from the build directory
and should not require configuration.

4. Development and plugins on Unix

Plugins make some aspects of development easier and some harder.

The first thing is that you'll have to run cmake once more to setup your
build environment.

The good news is that if you are working on a single plugin then you will
find recompiling the plugin MUCH faster than recompiling a dissector and
then linking it back into Wireshark. Use "make plugins" to compile just
your plugins.

The bad news is that Wireshark will not use the plugins unless the plugins
are installed in one of the places it expects them to find.

One way of dealing with this problem is to set an environment variable
when running Wireshark: WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY=1.

Another way to deal with this problem is to set up a working root for
wireshark, say in $HOME/build/root and build Wireshark to install
there

cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}/build/root && make install

then subsequent rebuilds/installs of your plugin can be accomplished
by going to the plugins/foo directory and running

make install

5. Plugin registration

5.1 Registration API common to all plugin types

You must include the plugin API header:

#include <wsutil/plugins.h>

First declare a struct with the plugin metadata fields:

static struct ws_module module = {
    .flags = WS_PLUGIN_DESC_DISSECTOR,
    .version = "X.Y.Z",
    .spdx_id = "GPL-2.0-or-later",
    .home_url = "Your-URL-here",
    .blurb = "Short description for the functionality",
    .register_cb = &plugin_register,
};

The flags field is currently only used to categorize a plugin according to its
functionality, for display purposes. A plugin can implement more than one
functionality type within each binary type, although this is rare in practice.

Version is a string and conventionally uses the format major.minor.micro,
although this isn't enforced.

The spdx_id field is the SPDX license ID for your plugin.

Home URL should be a string where users can obtain the source code
and other detailed information about the plugin.

The blurb is a short description of what the plugin does.

The plugin registration callback implementation is specific for each plugin
type (see the various plugins bundled with Wireshark for examples).

static void
plugin_register(void)
{
        /* Code to register the dissector, tap listener, etc. */
}

Finally the plugin must use one of the following macros to register itself:

WIRESHARK_PLUGIN_REGISTER_EPAN(&module, 0)
WIRESHARK_PLUGIN_REGISTER_WIRETAP(&module, 0)
WIRESHARK_PLUGIN_REGISTER_CODEC(&module, 0)

As the name implies each plugin binary type has a specific registration
macro (but they all have the same arguments). The macro takes a pointer to
the struct ws_module as the first argument. The second argument is
unused only by codec plugins and explained in the next section. For all
other plugin types it is ignored and should be zero.

5.2 The plugin minimum API level argument

The ABI version test for equality is the main check for compatibility for
all plugin types but additionally the codec plugin API has an extra
check called the API level. The codec API is very small and changes very
infrequently. Codecs plugins that only use the API in wsutil/codecs.h should
declare a minimum API level required. If the API needs to be changed and that
can be done in a backward-compatible manner for the ABI/API then only the
maximum API level will be increased and the minimum API level can stay the same.

This means the same plugin can still be loaded successfully without
recompilation using the older API (possibly with reduced functionality).

This is currently experimental and may change in the future or be removed
entirely.

6 How to plugin related interface options

To demonstrate the functionality of the plugin interface options, a
demonstration plugin exists (pluginifdemo). To build it using cmake, the
build option ENABLE_PLUGIN_IFDEMO has to be enabled.

6.1 Implement a plugin GUI menu

A plugin (as well as built-in dissectors) may implement a menu within
Wireshark to be used to trigger options, start tools, open Websites, ...

This menu structure is built using the plugin_if.h interface and its
corresponding functions.

The menu items all call a callback provided by the plugin, which takes
a pointer to the menuitem entry as data. This pointer may be used to
provide userdata to each entry. The pointer must utilize WS_DLL_PUBLIC_DEF
and has the following structure:

    WS_DLL_PUBLIC_DEF void
    menu_cb(ext_menubar_gui_type gui_type, void *gui_data,
            void *user_data _U_)
    {
        ... Do something ...
    }

The menu entries themselves are generated with the following code structure:

    ext_menu_t * ext_menu, *os_menu = NULL;

    ext_menu = ext_menubar_register_menu (
            <your_proto_item>, "Some Menu Entry", true );
    ext_menubar_add_entry(ext_menu, "Test Entry 1",
            "This is a tooltip", menu_cb, <user_data>);
    ext_menubar_add_entry(ext_menu, "Test Entry 2",
            NULL, menu_cb, <user_data>);

    os_menu = ext_menubar_add_submenu(ext_menu, "Sub Menu" );
    ext_menubar_add_entry(os_menu, "Test Entry A",
            NULL, menu_cb, <user_data>);
    ext_menubar_add_entry(os_menu, "Test Entry B",
            NULL, menu_cb, <user_data>);

For a more detailed information, please refer to plugin_if.h

6.2 Implement interactions with the main interface

Due to memory constraints on most platforms, plugin functionality cannot be
called directly from a DLL context. Instead special functions will be used,
which will implement certain options for plugins to utilize.

The following methods exist so far:

	/* Applies the given filter string as display filter */
	WS_DLL_PUBLIC void plugin_if_apply_filter
		(const char * filter_string, bool force);

	/* Saves the given preference to the main preference storage */
	WS_DLL_PUBLIC void plugin_if_save_preference
		(const char * pref_module, const char * pref_key, const char * pref_value);

	/* Jumps to the given frame number */
	WS_DLL_PUBLIC void plugin_if_goto_frame(uint32_t framenr);

6.3 Implement a plugin specific toolbar

A toolbar may be registered which allows implementing an interactive user
interaction with the main application. The toolbar is generated using the following
code:

    ext_toolbar_t * tb = ext_toolbar_register_toolbar("Plugin Interface Demo Toolbar");

This registers a toolbar, which will be shown underneath "View->Additional Toolbars" in
the main menu, as well as the popup action window when right-clicking on any other tool-
or menubar.

It behaves identically to the existing toolbars and can be hidden as well as defined to
appear specific to selected profiles. The name with which it is being shown is the given
name in this function call.

6.3.1 Register elements for the toolbar

To add items to the toolbar, 4 different types of elements do exist.

  * BOOLEAN - a checkbox to select / unselect
  * BUTTON - a button to click
  * STRING - a text field with validation options
  * SELECTOR - a dropdown selection field

To add an element to the toolbar, the following function is being used:

    ext_toolbar_add_entry( ext_toolbar_t * parent, ext_toolbar_item_t type, const char *label,
        const char *defvalue, const char *tooltip, bool capture_only, GList * value_list,
        bool is_required, const char * regex, ext_toolbar_action_cb callback, void *user_data)

    parent_bar - the parent toolbar for this entry, to be registered by ext_toolbar_register_toolbar
    name - the entry name (the internal used one) for the item, used to send updates to the element
    label - the entry label (the displayed name) for the item, visible to the user
    defvalue - the default value for the toolbar element
        - EXT_TOOLBAR_BOOLEAN - 1 is for a checked element, 0 is unchecked
        - EXT_TOOLBAR_STRING - Text already entered upon initial display
    tooltip - a tooltip to be displayed on mouse-over
    capture_only - entry is only active, if a capture is active
    callback - the action which will be invoked after the item is activated
    value_list - a non-null list of values created by ext_toolbar_add_val(), if the item type
        is EXT_TOOLBAR_SELECTOR
    valid_regex - a validation regular expression for EXT_TOOLBAR_STRING
    is_required - a zero entry for EXT_TOOLBAR_STRING is not allowed
    user_data - a user defined pointer, which will be added to the toolbar callback

In case of the toolbar type EXT_TOOLBAR_SELECTOR a value list has to be provided. This list
is generated using ext_toolbar_add_val():

    GList * entries = 0;
    entries = ext_toolbar_add_val(entries, "1", "ABCD", false );
    entries = ext_toolbar_add_val(entries, "2", "EFG", false );
    entries = ext_toolbar_add_val(entries, "3", "HIJ", true );
    entries = ext_toolbar_add_val(entries, "4", "KLM", false );

6.3.2 Callback for activation of an item

If an item has been activated, the provided callback is being triggered.

    void toolbar_cb(void *toolbar_item, void *item_data, void *user_data)

For EXT_TOOLBAR_BUTTON the callback is triggered upon a click on the button, for
EXT_TOOLBAR_BOOLEAN and EXT_TOOLBAR_SELECTOR the callback is triggered with every change
of the selection.

For EXT_TOOLBAR_STRING either the return key has to be hit or the apply button pressed.

The parameters of the callback are defined as follows:

    toolbar_item - an element of the type ext_toolbar_t * representing the item that has been
                   activated
    item_data - the data of the item during activation. The content depends on the item type:
         - EXT_TOOLBAR_BUTTON - the entry is null
         - EXT_TOOLBAR_BOOLEAN - the entry is 0 if the checkbox is unchecked and 1 if it is checked
         - EXT_TOOLBAR_STRING - a string representing the context of the textbox. Only valid strings
                   are being passed, it can be safely assumed, that an applied regular expression has
                   been checked.
         - EXT_TOOLBAR_SELECTOR - the value of the selected entry
    user_data - the data provided during element registration

6.3.3 Sending updates to the toolbar items

A plugin may send updates to the toolbar entry, using one of the following methods. The parameter
silent defines, if the registered toolbar callback is triggered by the update or not.

    void ext_toolbar_update_value(ext_toolbar_t * entry, void *data, bool silent)

    - EXT_TOOLBAR_BUTTON, EXT_TOOLBAR_STRING - the displayed text (on the button or in the textbox)
        are being changed, in that case data is expected to be a string
    - EXT_TOOLBAR_BOOLEAN - the checkbox value is being changed, to either 0 or 1, in both cases
        data is expected to be an integer sent by GINT_TO_POINTER(n)
    - EXT_TOOLBAR_SELECTOR - the display text to be changed. If no element exists with this text,
        nothing will happen

    void ext_toolbar_update_data(ext_toolbar_t * entry, void *data, bool silent)

    - EXT_TOOLBAR_SELECTOR - change the value list to the one provided with data. Attention! this
        does not change the list stored within the item just the one in the displayed combobox

    void ext_toolbar_update_data_by_index(ext_toolbar_t * entry, void *data, void *value,
        bool silent)

    - EXT_TOOLBAR_SELECTOR - change the display text for the entry with the provided value. Both
        data and value must be char * pointer.
