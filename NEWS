Wireshark 4.3.0 Release Notes

 This is an experimental release intended to test new features for
 Wireshark 4.4.

 What is Wireshark?

  Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
  used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

 What’s New

  Improved display filter support for value strings (optional string
  representations for numeric fields).

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 4.2.0:

     • Display filter syntax-related enhancements:

        • Better handling of comparisons with value strings. Now the
       display filter engine can correctly handle cases where multiple
       different numeric values map to the same value string, including
       but not limited to range-type value strings.

        • Fields with value strings now support regular expression
       matching.

 Getting Wireshark

  Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
  https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can
   be found on the download page[1] on the Wireshark web site.

 File Locations

  Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
  preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These
  locations vary from platform to platform. You can use "Help › About
  Wireshark › Folders" or `tshark -G folders` to find the default
  locations on your system.

 Getting Help

  The User’s Guide, manual pages and various other documentation can be
  found at https://www.wireshark.org/docs/

  Community support is available on Wireshark’s Q&A site[2] and on the
  wireshark-users mailing list. Subscription information and archives
  for all of Wireshark’s mailing lists can be found on the web site[3].
