Wireshark 4.1.0 Release Notes

 This is an experimental release intended to test new features for
 Wireshark 4.2.

 What is Wireshark?

  Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
  used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

 What’s New

  Wireshark is now better about generating valid UTF-8 output.

  A new display filter feature for filtering raw bytes has been added.

  Many other improvements have been made. See the “New and Updated
  Features” section below for more details.

  Bug Fixes

   The following bugs have been fixed:

     • Issue 18413[1] - RTP player do not play audio frequently on Win32
       builds with Qt6

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 4.0.0:

     • The API has been updated to ensure that the dissection engine
       produces valid UTF-8 strings.

     • Wireshark now builds with Qt6 by default. To use Qt5 instead pass
       USE_qt6=OFF to CMake.

     • It is now possible to filter on raw packet data for any field by
       using the syntax `@some.field == <bytes…​>`. This can be useful
       to filter on malformed UTF-8 strings, among other use cases where
       it is necessary to look at the field’s raw data.

  New Protocol Support

   Management Component Transport Protocol (MCTP), Management Component
   Transport Protocol - Control Protocol (MCTP CP), Non-volatile Memory
   Express - Management Interface (NVMe-MI) over MCTP, SAP Enqueue
   Server (SAPEnqueue), SAP HANA SQL Command Network Protocol (SAPHDB),
   SAP Internet Graphic Server (SAP IGS), SAP Network Interface (SAPNI),
   Support for almost all WoW 1.12 messages has been added., and World
   of Warcraft World (WOWW) display filters have been changed to be more
   internally consistent.

  Updated Protocol Support

     • The JSON dissector now has a preference to enable/disable
       "unescaping" of string values. By default it is off. Previously
       it was always on.

   Too many protocols have been updated to list here.

  New and Updated Capture File Support

   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can

 File Locations

  Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
  preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These
  locations vary from platform to platform. You can use "Help › About
  Wireshark › Folders" or `tshark -G folders` to find the default
  locations on your system.
