Wireshark 4.1.0 Release Notes

 This is an experimental release intended to test new features for
 Wireshark 4.2.

 What is Wireshark?

  Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
  used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

 What’s New

  Wireshark is now better about generating valid UTF-8 output.

  Many other improvements have been made. See the “New and Updated
  Features” section below for more details.

  Bug Fixes

   The following bugs have been fixed:

     • Issue 18413[1] - RTP player do not play audio frequently on Win32
       builds with Qt6

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 4.0.0:

     • The API has been updated to ensure that the dissection engine
       produces valid UTF-8 strings.

     • Wireshark now builds with Qt6 by default. To use Qt5 instead pass
       USE_qt6=OFF to CMake.

  Removed Features and Support

     • The experimental display filter syntax for literals using angle
       brackets <…​> that was introduced in Wireshark 4.0.0 has been
       removed. For byte arrays a colon prefix can be used instead. See

 Getting Wireshark

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can
   be found on the download page[3] on the Wireshark web site.

 File Locations

  Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
  preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These
  locations vary from platform to platform. You can use "Help › About
  Wireshark › Folders" or `tshark -G folders` to find the default
  locations on your system.
