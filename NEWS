Wireshark 4.1.0 Release Notes

 This is an experimental release intended to test new features for
 Wireshark 4.2.

 What is Wireshark?

  Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
  used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

 What’s New

  Wireshark is now better about generating valid UTF-8 output.

  A new display filter feature for filtering raw bytes has been added.

  Display filter autocomplete is smarter about not suggesting invalid
  syntax.

  The Windows build has a new SpeexDSP external dependency
  (https://www.speex.org). The speex code that was previously bundled
  has been removed.

  The personal extcap plugin folder location on Unix has been changed to
  follow existing conventions for architecture-dependent files. The
  extcap personal folder is now `$HOME/.local/lib/wireshark/extcap`.
  Previously it was `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark/extcap`.

  The installation target no longer installs development headers by
  default. That must be done explicitly using `cmake --install
  <builddir> --component Development`.

  Many other improvements have been made. See the “New and Updated
  Features” section below for more details.

  Bug Fixes

   The following bugs have been fixed:

     • Issue 18413[1] - RTP player do not play audio frequently on Win32
       builds with Qt6

     • Issue 18510[2] - Playback marker do not move after unpause with
       Qt6

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 4.0.0:

     • The API has been updated to ensure that the dissection engine
       produces valid UTF-8 strings.

     • Wireshark now builds with Qt6 by default. To use Qt5 instead pass
       USE_qt6=OFF to CMake.

     • It is now possible to filter on raw packet data for any field by
       using the syntax `@some.field == <bytes…​>`. This can be useful
       to filter on malformed UTF-8 strings, among other use cases where
       it is necessary to look at the field’s raw data.

     • Negation (unary minus) now works with any display filter
       arithmetic expression.

     • ciscodump support Cisco IOS XE 17.x

  New Protocol Support

   DECT DLC protocol layer (DECT-DLC), DECT NWK protocol layer
   (DECT-NWK), DECT proprietary Mitel OMM/RFP Protocol (also named
   AaMiDe), Low Level Signalling (ATSC3 LLS), Management Component
   Transport Protocol (MCTP), Management Component Transport Protocol -
   Control Protocol (MCTP CP), Non-volatile Memory Express - Management
   Interface (NVMe-MI) over MCTP, SAP Enqueue Server (SAPEnqueue), SAP
   GUI (SAPDiag), SAP HANA SQL Command Network Protocol (SAPHDB), SAP
   Internet Graphic Server (SAP IGS), SAP Message Server (SAPMS), SAP
   Network Interface (SAPNI), SAP Router (SAPROUTER), SAP Secure Network
   Connection (SNC), Support for almost all WoW 1.12 messages has been
   added., and World of Warcraft World (WOWW) display filters have been
   changed to be more internally consistent.

  Updated Protocol Support

     • The JSON dissector now has a preference to enable/disable
       "unescaping" of string values. By default it is off. Previously
       it was always on.

     • The JSON dissector now supports "Display JSON in raw form".

     • The IPv6 dissector has a new preference to show some semantic
       details about addresses (default off).

   Too many other protocols have been updated to list them all here.

  New and Updated Capture File Support

 Getting Wireshark

  Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
  https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can
   be found on the download page[3] on the Wireshark web site.

 File Locations

  Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
  preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These
  locations vary from platform to platform. You can use "Help › About
  Wireshark › Folders" or `tshark -G folders` to find the default
  locations on your system.

 Getting Help

  The User’s Guide, manual pages and various other documentation can be
  found at https://www.wireshark.org/docs/

  Community support is available on Wireshark’s Q&A site[4] and on the
  wireshark-users mailing list. Subscription information and archives
  for all of Wireshark’s mailing lists can be found on the web site[5].

  Bugs and feature requests can be reported on the issue tracker[6].

  You can learn protocol analysis and meet Wireshark’s developers at
  SharkFest[7].

 How You Can Help

  The Wireshark Foundation helps as many people as possible understand
  their networks as much as possible. You can find out more and donate
  at wiresharkfoundation.org[8].
