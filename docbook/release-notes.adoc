= Wireshark {wireshark-version} Release Notes
// Asciidoctor Syntax Quick Reference:
// https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/

This is an experimental release intended to test new features for Wireshark 4.2.

== What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer.
It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

== What’s New

// Add a summary of major changes here.
// Add other changes to "New and Updated Features" below.

Wireshark is now better about generating valid UTF-8 output.

A new display filter feature for filtering raw bytes has been added.

Display filter autocomplete is smarter about not suggesting invalid syntax.

The Windows build has a new SpeexDSP external dependency (https://www.speex.org).
The speex code that was previously bundled has been removed.

Many other improvements have been made.
See the “New and Updated Features” section below for more details.

=== Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed:

* wsbuglink:18413[No Audio in RTP player with Wireshark 4.0.0] - RTP player do not play audio frequently on Win32 builds with Qt6

* wsbuglink:18510[Paused playback cannot continue to play] - Playback marker do not move after unpause with Qt6


//* wsbuglink:5000[]
//* wsbuglink:6000[Wireshark bug]
//* cveidlink:2014-2486[]
//* Wireshark grabs your ID at 3 am, goes to Waffle House, and insults people.

=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated) since version 4.0.0:

// * The Windows installers now ship with Npcap 1.71.
//   They previously shipped with Npcap 1.60.

* The API has been updated to ensure that the dissection engine produces valid UTF-8 strings.

* Wireshark now builds with Qt6 by default. To use Qt5 instead pass USE_qt6=OFF to CMake.

* It is now possible to filter on raw packet data for any field by using the syntax ``@some.field == <bytes...>``.
  This can be useful to filter on malformed UTF-8 strings, among other use cases where it is necessary to
  look at the field's raw data.

* Negation (unary minus) now works with any display filter arithmetic expression.

* ciscodump support Cisco IOS XE 17.x
